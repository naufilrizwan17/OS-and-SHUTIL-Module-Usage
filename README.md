The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python's standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. The *os* and *os. path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system. These functions are very useful since you can easily access, create, remove, rename directories.
